# Execution Log & Decision Tree Journal

## Phase 0 Â· Due Diligence & Alignment

### 0.1 Requirements Traceability Reconstruction

#### 0.1.1 Repository Inventory
- [x] 0.1.1.1 Script deep repo scan (code, infra, data)
  - Notes:
    - Objective: produce authoritative catalog of existing assets vs. PRP claims.
    - Constraints: no placeholder output, must support future automation and JSON export for traceability matrix.
    - Decision Tree:
      - Language options considered: Python vs. Go.
        - Python selected for rapid iteration, existing availability, rich stdlib (`pathlib`, `argparse`).
      - Output formats:
        - Markdown summary for human review.
        - JSON artifact for downstream tooling (traceability matrix automation).
      - Scope of scan:
        - Include file type classification (code/infra/docs/assets/other).
        - Capture file size, extension, and relative path for accuracy.
        - Ignore Git internals (`.git`, `.mypy_cache`, `__pycache__`).
    - Implementation Highlights:
      - Designed `DirectoryStats` aggregation model to accumulate hierarchical metrics without double counting.
      - Built CLI supporting configurable ignore lists plus JSON/Markdown export destinations.
      - Generated baseline artifacts:
        - JSON: `reports/due_diligence/repo_inventory.json`
        - Markdown: `reports/due_diligence/repo_inventory.md`
    - Validation:
      - Executed scan against repository root with default ignores.
      - Verified Markdown summary tables render full category coverage and top-20 largest files for rapid audit.
- [x] 0.1.1.2 Build traceability matrix mapping TRD requirements to assets
- Notes:
  - Objective: transform PRP requirements into machine-readable hierarchy and cross-check against actual repository evidence.
  - Decision Tree:
    - Requirements source options: parse raw PRP markdown vs. curate structured dataset.
      - Curated JSON selected to preserve semantic fidelity while enabling deterministic IDs and keyword metadata for automation.
    - Coverage evaluation strategies: manual review only vs. automated keyword heuristics + override channel.
      - Implemented hybrid: default keyword-based matching augmented by explicit override file for adjudicated outcomes.
    - Output targets: Markdown only vs. Markdown + JSON for downstream analytics.
      - Generated both formats to support audit readability and machine consumption.
  - Implementation Highlights:
    - Authored `reports/due_diligence/trd_requirements.json` capturing 28 leaf requirements across seven domains with keyword hints.
    - Added `reports/due_diligence/traceability_overrides.json` to document human-reviewed adjustments (e.g., README partial coverage).
    - Built `tools/traceability_matrix.py` producing JSON + Markdown matrices, aggregating statuses bottom-up, and summarizing coverage ratios.
    - Emitted baseline traceability artifacts showing 27 unmet requirements and 1 partial documentation item.
  - Validation:
    - Executed matrix generator referencing existing repo inventory outputs.
    - Reviewed Markdown report to confirm category tables, coverage evidence, and summary metrics align with expectations.
- [ ] 0.1.1.3 Gap analysis with severity scoring

### 0.1.2 Stakeholder Interviews & Monetization Validation
- Pending activation post-inventory insights.

## Parking Lot / Risks
- Ensure generated reports do not include sensitive binaries; consider hashing large files instead of copying contents.
- Plan for future integration with CI to keep inventory current.
