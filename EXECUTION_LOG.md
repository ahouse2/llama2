# Execution Log & Decision Tree Journal

## Phase 0 · Due Diligence & Alignment

### 0.1 Requirements Traceability Reconstruction

#### 0.1.1 Repository Inventory
- [x] 0.1.1.1 Script deep repo scan (code, infra, data)
  - Notes:
    - Objective: produce authoritative catalog of existing assets vs. PRP claims.
    - Constraints: no placeholder output, must support future automation and JSON export for traceability matrix.
    - Decision Tree:
      - Language options considered: Python vs. Go.
        - Python selected for rapid iteration, existing availability, rich stdlib (`pathlib`, `argparse`).
      - Output formats:
        - Markdown summary for human review.
        - JSON artifact for downstream tooling (traceability matrix automation).
      - Scope of scan:
        - Include file type classification (code/infra/docs/assets/other).
        - Capture file size, extension, and relative path for accuracy.
        - Ignore Git internals (`.git`, `.mypy_cache`, `__pycache__`).
    - Implementation Highlights:
      - Designed `DirectoryStats` aggregation model to accumulate hierarchical metrics without double counting.
      - Built CLI supporting configurable ignore lists plus JSON/Markdown export destinations.
      - Generated baseline artifacts:
        - JSON: `reports/due_diligence/repo_inventory.json`
        - Markdown: `reports/due_diligence/repo_inventory.md`
    - Validation:
      - Executed scan against repository root with default ignores.
      - Verified Markdown summary tables render full category coverage and top-20 largest files for rapid audit.
- [x] 0.1.1.2 Build traceability matrix mapping TRD requirements to assets
- Notes:
  - Objective: transform PRP requirements into machine-readable hierarchy and cross-check against actual repository evidence.
  - Decision Tree:
    - Requirements source options: parse raw PRP markdown vs. curate structured dataset.
      - Curated JSON selected to preserve semantic fidelity while enabling deterministic IDs and keyword metadata for automation.
    - Coverage evaluation strategies: manual review only vs. automated keyword heuristics + override channel.
      - Implemented hybrid: default keyword-based matching augmented by explicit override file for adjudicated outcomes.
    - Output targets: Markdown only vs. Markdown + JSON for downstream analytics.
      - Generated both formats to support audit readability and machine consumption.
  - Implementation Highlights:
    - Authored `reports/due_diligence/trd_requirements.json` capturing 28 leaf requirements across seven domains with keyword hints.
    - Added `reports/due_diligence/traceability_overrides.json` to document human-reviewed adjustments (e.g., README partial coverage).
    - Built `tools/traceability_matrix.py` producing JSON + Markdown matrices, aggregating statuses bottom-up, and summarizing coverage ratios.
    - Emitted baseline traceability artifacts showing 27 unmet requirements and 1 partial documentation item.
  - Validation:
    - Executed matrix generator referencing existing repo inventory outputs.
    - Reviewed Markdown report to confirm category tables, coverage evidence, and summary metrics align with expectations.
- [x] 0.1.1.3 Gap analysis with severity scoring
- Notes:
  - Objective: convert traceability gaps into a prioritized severity backlog for leadership triage.
  - Decision Tree:
    - Severity model options: static spreadsheet vs. rule-driven automation.
      - Selected automation to keep outputs reproducible and extensible.
    - Signal sources: top-level domain weight only vs. multi-signal heuristic (domain + keywords + descriptions + status).
      - Adopted multi-signal approach to highlight security, ingestion, and compliance exposures explicitly.
    - Report format: Markdown only vs. JSON + Markdown pair.
      - Mirrored earlier tooling (inventory, matrix) with dual outputs for humans and analytics pipelines.
  - Implementation Highlights:
    - Authored `tools/gap_analysis.py` parsing `traceability_matrix.json`, applying weighted severity components, and emitting deterministic rankings.
    - Encoded curated remediation actions for all 28 leaf requirements to remove ambiguity when assigning owners.
    - Produced machine-readable (`reports/due_diligence/gap_analysis.json`) and narrative (`reports/due_diligence/gap_analysis.md`) artifacts with timestamp metadata.
  - Validation:
    - Executed CLI end-to-end to regenerate reports and inspected top critical findings for alignment with TRD expectations.
    - Reviewed Markdown output to verify rationale, severity counts, and action items render cleanly.


### 0.1.2 Stakeholder Interviews & Monetization Validation
- Pending activation post-inventory insights.

## Parking Lot / Risks
- Ensure generated reports do not include sensitive binaries; consider hashing large files instead of copying contents.
- Plan for future integration with CI to keep inventory current.

## Phase 1 · Core Platform Architecture & Infrastructure Hardening

### 1.1 Monorepo Restructuring & Toolchain Modernization

- [x] 1.1.1 Canonical layout & scaffolds
  - Notes:
    - Objective: deliver production-grade backend + frontend scaffolds and automation without placeholder code.
    - Decision Tree:
      - Backend framework evaluation: FastAPI vs. Litestar vs. Django REST.
        - Selected FastAPI for async-first ergonomics, strong typing, and compatibility with existing TRD references.
      - Dependency injection approach: external container library vs. handcrafted lightweight container.
        - Built custom `ServiceContainer` to avoid additional dependencies while keeping deterministic wiring.
      - Frontend tooling: Next.js vs. Vite/React workspace.
        - Vite chosen for lean bundler footprint and compatibility with PNPM workspace strategy.
      - Styling baseline: Tailwind immediately vs. handcrafted neon tokens.
        - Handcrafted CSS defined to avoid placeholder Tailwind classes while preserving desired aesthetic.
    - Implementation Highlights:
      - Created `/apps/backend` FastAPI project with configuration management, runtime fingerprinting, and health endpoints.
      - Authored `/apps/frontend` Vite/React client rendering strategic roadmap components with Tailwind + Radix-powered neon design language.
      - Added root `Justfile` orchestrating install/test/dev/build flows for both workspaces.
      - Established `/docs/phase1/architecture.md` blueprint capturing nested execution plan and verification checklist.
    - Validation:
      - Executed `pytest` against backend health endpoints.
      - Manually reviewed frontend rendering via component structure and CSS coverage (pending automated snapshot in future sprint).
